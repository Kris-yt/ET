          6.4 Monitoring Transactions
          <br />
          The Users are known not only by verifying their identity (who they
          are) but, more importantly, by analyzing their transactional patterns
          (what they do). Therefore, LegendLink relies on data analysis as a
          risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool. LegendLink performs a
          variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data,
          filtering, record-keeping, investigation management, and reporting.
          System functionalities include:
          <br />
          Daily check of Users against recognized "blacklists" (e.g. PAGCOR
          National Database of Restricted Persons), aggregating transfers by
          multiple data points, placing Users on watch and service denial lists,
          opening cases for investigation where needed, sending internal
          communications and filling out statutory reports, if applicable; case
          and document management.
          <br />
          With regard to the KYC Policy, LegendLink will monitor all
          transactions and it reserves the right to: Ensure that transactions of
          suspicious nature are reported to the proper law enforcement through
          the Compliance Officer; Request the User to provide any additional
          information and documents in case of suspicious transactions; Suspend
          or terminate User's Account when LegendLink has reasonable suspicion
          that such User engaged in illegal activity.
          <br />
          The above list is not exhaustive, and the Compliance Officer will
          monitor Users' transactions on a day-to-day basis in order to define
          whether such transactions are to be reported and treated as suspicious
          or are to be treated as bona fide.
          <br />
          6.5 Risk Assessment LegendLink, in line with the PAGCOR compliance,
          has adopted a risk-based approach to combating money laundering and
          terrorist financing. By adopting a risk-based approach, LegendLink is
          able to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering
          and terrorist financing are commensurate to the identified risks. This
          will allow resources to be allocated in the most efficient ways. The
          principle is that resources should be directed in accordance with
          priorities so that the greatest risks receive the highest attention.
